🧩 Problem

Implement a function:

function getOpenDays(schedule, time) { ... }

Parameters:

schedule: an array of objects, each describing the store’s open and close time for specific days.
Example:

[
  { days: "Wednesday-Friday", open: "8:00 AM", close: "6:00 PM" },
  { days: "Monday", open: "10:00 AM", close: "6:00 PM" },
  { days: "Sunday", open: null, close: null } // Always open
]


time: a string, e.g. "11:00 AM"

Output:

An array of strings representing the days that are open at the given time.
For example:

getOpenDays(schedule, "11:00 AM")
// → ["Monday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Sunday"]
